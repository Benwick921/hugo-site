<h2> <span style="color:#da1953">Abo</span>ut Me </h2>

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

Many people call me "hacker", other call me "engineer" but most of them call me to repair their pc and mobile phones...

I have a background in Computer Science, during that time I developed interest in cyber security. At the moment I am doing my master in cyber security.

My main interest is binary exploitation and penetrations testing. I also like to do malware analysis and network security. My final goal is to become a vulnerability researcher and bug bounty hunter. I constantly keep training and self teaching myself by doing CTFs.

<h2> <span style="color:#da1953">Sum</span>mary</h2>

I will be graduating soon in cybersecurity master’s degree at the La Sapienza University of Rome. I have solid foundation of all fields of security out of which my strengths lie within penetration testing, binary exploitation, reverse engineering and malware analysis. 

My passion for cybersecurity has led me to learn many techniques both independently and through online courses that have been very useful for my work and study course.

I am more and more interested in learning new technical skills, so I always keep up to date by attending communities of ethical hackers, studying on my own and doing CTFs. I am interested in working in the field of offensive security as being part of a read team.
